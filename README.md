A working full-stack application, built using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.

The application showcases the shopping cart features of a e-commerce site. It also includes Authorization, which includes sign up/login functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow. It also includes related models in a one-to-many relationship -- there is one category for many items and there are many orders to one user.

Authorization: A user must be logged in in order to create new orders or view order history:
